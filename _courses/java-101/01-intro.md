1: Course introduction
-----------------------
Java 101 course is a basic programming course in Java. The focus is not 
so much on going over every feature Java offers but more on how a basic
piece of software is built. We happen to use Java as the language but
after finishing this course you will find it easy to apply your learnings
to other programming languages just as easily.

## Programming language vs Natural language
When building a program, we are writing instructions that tells a computer
what to do. We've all use computer programs before. But what if we want to
build our own program? 

For building our own program, we have to use a programming language and 
write detailed instruction that tells the computer what to do.

A programming language is what the name suggests: a language. It's a language
built to tell a computer what to do, and because of computers being more
dumb than human beings, the language is more limited than a natural language
(i.e. English, French, Spanish, etc). In that sense, you can look at this
course as a language course to some extend.

## Course structure
First we go over installing the tools we need for building and running a Java application.
After that, each lesson comes in three parts:

* Part a: Covers a new language construct. What it is and how it can be used.
* Part b: Comes with practise problems, hints on how to solve them and link
to the solutions.

At the end, you will find the course project where we build the 
[2048 game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wnNGzMn5csQ) in Java.
