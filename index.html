                                    <div>
                                        In Miare I am a member of a highly talented, vibrant team, working on
                                        development
                                        and
                                        maintenance of a pre-existing but ever changing product and MVP of a new
                                        product.
                                        My responsibilities mostly consists of proposing suitable technical and
                                        architectural
                                        solutions
                                        for business requirements and developing backend code. In our delivery product
                                        we
                                        have two
                                        different codebases responsible for different aspects of the system, they have
                                        some
                                        realtime
                                        features implemented using websockets and a lot of REST-based endpoints. Both
                                        codebases have
                                        good test-coverage, leverage CI, CD and are highly maintainable.

                                        I've done a massive refactoring and basically rewritten most of our GO codebase,
                                        and
                                        have
                                        developed a large portion of our Django code in the pre-existing product and
                                        have
                                        had large
                                        impact on architectural and technical decisions of MVP of the new product.

                                        I contributed to development of some REST APIs and an admin panel for an online
                                        realtime game called Boom with over 50k users. The project was done using a java
                                        framework called Dropwizard and its modules including jersey, hibernate,
                                        freemarker,
                                        etc. For the admin panel I used HTML, bootstrap and jquery in addition to
                                        aforementioned technologies.
                                        The game is available at

                                        to two projects. One was called SMS panel which provided SMS support integrated

                                        their Email service and the other was Senfi. The latter was a website through
                                        which
                                        companies could publish advertisements and other users could see those
                                        advertisements and comment on them through their mobile devices. I worked there
