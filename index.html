                        I'm a passionate software engineer, opting for
                        delivery of maintainable, reliable software that also meets the deadlines.

                        In my day job I am known for conforming to software engineering patterns and practices,
                        delivering things on time and a desire for solving new problems. In my free time I try to
                        improve that reputation by contributing to open source projects, learning new practices and
                        technologies, writing blog posts and doing side projects.

                                            Miare is a B2B food delivery company. It provides restaurants with a panel
                                            through which they can ask for a courier to deliver their food to their
                                            customers.

                                        <p>
                                            In Miare I was a member of a highly talented, vibrant team, working on
                                            development and maintenance of aforementioned product which had complex
                                            technical, financial and operational aspects. My responsibilities
                                            mostly consisted of proposing suitable technical and architectural solutions
                                            for business requirements and developing backend code. In Miare we had two
                                            different codebases responsible for different aspects of the system, they
                                            had some
                                            realtime features implemented using websockets and a lot of REST-based
                                            endpoints. Both codebases had good test-coverage, leveraged CI, CD and were
                                            highly maintainable. I've done a massive refactoring and basically rewritten
                                            most of the GO codebase, and have developed a large portion of the Django
                                            code.

                                        I contributed to development of some REST APIs and an admin panel for an online
                                        realtime game called Boom with over 50k users. The project was done using a java
                                        framework called Dropwizard and its modules including jersey, hibernate,
                                        freemarker,
                                        etc. For the admin panel I used HTML, bootstrap and jquery in addition to
                                        aforementioned technologies.
                                        The game is available at

                                        to two projects. One was called SMS panel which provided SMS support integrated

                                        their Email service and the other was Senfi. The latter was a website through

                                        companies could publish advertisements and other users could see those
                                        advertisements and comment on them through their mobile devices. I worked there

                                        I have taught general chemistry to students in several different schools in
                                        order to
                                        prepare them for Iranian National Chemistry Olympiad. I also wrote a book
                                        consisting
                                        of a collection of general chemistry problems which is going to be published by
                                        IRYSC publication this year.
